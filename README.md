# Tang Nano 9K VGA Output

## Description
This is a beginner project using [Tang Nano 9K](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-9K/Nano-9K.html) FPGA for doing VGA output using modified timings of [SVGA Signal 800x600 @ 60 Hz](http://www.tinyvga.com/vga-timing/800x600@60Hz). The inspiration came from [Ben Eater's series on building a Video Card](https://eater.net/vga)!
